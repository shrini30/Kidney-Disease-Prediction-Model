# Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Model

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a rising worldwide health concern, impacting roughly 10% of the world's population and causing severe morbidity and death if not detected and treated early on. The illness often proceeds gradually, with symptoms appearing only after the condition has progressed, making early discovery important for successful treatment. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health issue characterized by a gradual decline in kidney function, often leading to severe complications such as kidney failure.  
Traditional diagnostic approaches depend significantly on the manual analysis of clinical data, such as blood testing, urine analysis, and imaging investigations, which may be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Furthermore, these approaches may fail to detect obscure trends or early warning signals of renal disease. In recent years, the fast growth of machine learning and artificial intelligence has created new opportunities for illness prediction and diagnosis. Using vast datasets and advanced algorithms, complicated correlations between numerous health markers may now be identified and the possibility of kidney disease predicted more accurately. The purpose of this research study is to investigate the potential benefits of machine learning approaches in predicting kidney illness by evaluating patient health data, with the objective of creating a dependable, scalable, and effective system for early diagnosis. The research aims to overcome the limits of current diagnostic approaches and add to the expanding body of information about the use of artificial intelligence in medical.
